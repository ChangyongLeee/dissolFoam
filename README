This is the OpenFoam solver.

It solves for steady flow (Stokes or inertial) and transport
Mesh motion now in dissolMotion boundary condition (libsFoamAux)
Reaction boundary conditions (nonlinear/danckwerts) are coded BC's
In constant/bcInclude (templates in libsFoamAux/boundaryConditions)

This version works with OpenFOAM 4.x and v1706

The moving interface in polyMesh/boundary should go last.
